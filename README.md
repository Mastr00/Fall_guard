# Fall_guard
As part of a project for our study in electronics and wireless communication we made a fall detector

All people have a risk of having a serious fall in an isolated place, whether it is an elderly person in a bathtub or an explorer on a mountain, our idea is simple, detect falls and inform the emergency services and the victim's relatives as quickly as possible When the person falls, the fall is automatically detected by the accelerometer, the system analyzes the fall, and if the person does not get up, the device directly sends an "SOS" and GPS coordinates to help and loved ones.

# The code
For the code it is based on Mr. Ferrero's code @FabienFerrero 
and we added the sum vectors magnitude acceleration

# Notification 
for notifications we simply use “tago.io”

# the elements that we used
we only use the accelerometer on the card provided
